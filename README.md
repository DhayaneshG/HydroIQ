# HydroIQ
HydroIQ is a low-cost, scalable, and sustainable water purification system designed to provide safe drinking water to rural, remote, and disaster-affected communities. The project addresses the global clean water crisis by delivering an off-grid, portable, and easy-to-deploy purification solution that works even in resource-constrained environments.

By combining multi-stage filtration with solar-powered operation, HydroIQ ensures reliable access to clean water without the need for complex infrastructure or continuous electricity supply.

## Overview
HydroIQ is a low-cost, scalable, and sustainable water purification system designed to provide safe drinking water to rural, remote, and disaster-affected communities. The project addresses the global clean water crisis by delivering an off-grid, portable, and easy-to-deploy purification solution that works even in resource-constrained environments.

By combining multi-stage filtration with solar-powered operation, HydroIQ ensures reliable access to clean water without the need for complex infrastructure or continuous electricity supply.
HydroIQ is a low-cost, scalable, and sustainable water purification system developed to deliver safe drinking water to rural, remote, and disaster-affected communities. It tackles the global clean water challenge through a multi-stage purification process—mesh screening, activated carbon filtration, and optional UV-LED disinfection—powered by solar energy, making it ideal for off-grid deployment.

The system achieves over 90% reduction in waterborne diseases, reduces reliance on bottled water, and operates with minimal maintenance and infrastructure. Its modular, portable design allows rapid installation in schools, health centers, relief camps, and community water points, ensuring reliable access to clean water when and where it is needed most.

HydroIQ is built around the principles of accessibility, affordability, and resilience, and aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 – Good Health, SDG 6 – Clean Water, SDG 7 – Clean Energy, and SDG 13 – Climate Action). This project highlights how engineering-driven innovation can create measurable social and environmental impact by transforming clean water from a privilege into a basic human right.
