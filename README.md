# HydroIQ



📌 Overview

HydroIQ is a low-cost, scalable, and sustainable water purification system designed to provide safe drinking water to rural, remote, and disaster-affected communities. The project addresses the global clean water crisis by delivering an off-grid, portable, and easy-to-deploy purification solution that works even in resource-constrained environments.

By combining multi-stage filtration with solar-powered operation, HydroIQ ensures reliable access to clean water without the need for complex infrastructure or continuous electricity supply.
